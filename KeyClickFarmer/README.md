# KeyCount Farmer
Thank you for your interest!

## Description
This is the game of using key-typing counts.  
When you type a character, the points in the status bar increase 1pt.  
And you can exchange the points to the power of getting more points.  
Let's earn a lot of points by continuing key typing!
