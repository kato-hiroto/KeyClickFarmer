# KeyClick Farmer
Thank you for your interest!

## Description
This is the game of using key-typing counts.  
When you type a character, the points in the status bar increase 1pt.  
And you can exchange the points to the power of getting more points.  
Let's earn a lot of points by continuing key typing!

## StatusBar Buttons
### points
This is your now points.  
Exchange the points to the power when you click.  
And you can see the more status of your typings at the output window.

## Information -> Energy
In this game, you get points for one key-typing automatically every second.  
But if the energy is empty, that system stops.  
Energy is consumed 1 in every second, recovering by 10 for one key-typing.
